# personal-standards

This repo will contain all the rules I like to follow when it comes to frontend development.

The rules are distributed by folder based on what you need. If the folder contains a "general.md" file, that will apply to all the content of that folder. For example, if the "files" folder contains a "general.md" file, all files will have to apply the rules defined on "general.md"
