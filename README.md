# personal-standards

This repo will contain all the rules I like to follow when it comes to frontend development.

The rules are distributed by folder based on what you need. If the folder contains a "general.md" file, that will apply to all the content of that folder. For example, if the "files" folder contains a "general.md" file, all files will have to apply the rules defined on "general.md"

- To know how to organize folders and files, check the "structure" folder
- To know what to write inside the different files, check the "files" folder
- To know what are my favourite libraries to work with, refer to the [libraries](libraries.md) file
